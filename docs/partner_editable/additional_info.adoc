== Post-deployment steps

After deploying this QuickStart you should setup an integration in https://app.urban.io following the steps described in https://support.urban.io/support/solutions/articles/43000627793-integration-with-aws-iot-sitewise/preview[this tutorial] and the framework automatically will import the selected data from the {partner-product-short-name} application's asset-hierarchy into AWS IoT SiteWise models and assets.

=== Test the deployment

After creating the integration in https://app.urban.io you can verify that the lambdas are executed without errors and that records are being populated in the dynamo tables.

== Update steps
AWS CloudFormation provides two methods for updating stacks: direct update or creating and executing change sets. When you directly update a stack, you submit changes and AWS CloudFormation immediately deploys them. Use direct updates when you want to quickly deploy your updates.

With change sets, you can preview the changes AWS CloudFormation will make to your stack, and then decide whether to apply those changes. Change sets are JSON-formatted documents that summarize the changes AWS CloudFormation will make to a stack. Use change sets when you want to ensure that AWS CloudFormation doesn't make unintentional changes or when you want to consider several options. For example, you can use a change set to verify that AWS CloudFormation won't replace your stack's database instances during an update.

//== Security
// Provide post-deployment best practices for using the technology on AWS, including considerations such as migrating data, backups, ensuring high performance, high availability, etc. Link to software documentation for detailed information.

//_Add any security-related information._

//== Other useful information
//Provide any other information of interest to users, especially focusing on areas where AWS or cloud usage differs from on-premises usage.

//_Add any other details that will help the customer use the software on AWS._
